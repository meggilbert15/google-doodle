# Google Doogle
This Google doodle was created to celebrate my birthday and is complete with the only thing I would want for my birthday--little wildflowers of my favorite colors. I chose to create wildflowers because I've always enjoyed picking the dainty, colorful wildflowers from my front yard and keeping them in a vase next to my bed. These flowers remind me of life's simple beauties, bringing me inner peace. I created the svg of me making a peace sign to show the peace that the flowers bring to my life.
